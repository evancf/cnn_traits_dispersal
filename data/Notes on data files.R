# Because we won't share large files over github, here are some notes on what this folder should contain

# Input data

# TRY data, which is a tab separated txt file currently called 13238.txt
# Will want multimedia.txt in here too 



# Output data / data saved at certain steps

# This is things like the 'species_links.txt' and 'Dat_full_ready_for_sampling.txt'
